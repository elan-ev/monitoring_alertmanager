# Ansible Role for the alertmanager

![molecule](https://github.com/elan-ev/monitoring_loki/actions/workflows/molecule.yml/badge.svg)

Install the latest [alertmanager](https://github.com/prometheus/alertmanager) version with [ansible](https://docs.ansible.com/).
This role is the multi-os ansible equivalent of https://github.com/lkiesow/prometheus-rpm.

## Role Variables

You can specify which template files to use for your configuration.
The role installs the default configuration, which you will likely want to extend or change
(see the [alertmanager config options](https://github.com/prometheus/alertmanager#example) for that).
To pass your own configuration file, specify the path to the jinja template in the variable `alertmanager_config_template`.

Additionally, an `.env`-file is installed that expands the command line arguments of how prometheus is called by systemd.
Here you can also pass your individual file via the variable `alertmanager_env_file`, so you are not limited to these values.

Keep in mind that you also need to specify the alert rules in your prometheus config.

## Example Playbook

Just add the role to your playbook:

```yaml
- hosts: all
  become: true
  roles:
    - role: elan.monitoring_alertmanager
      alertmanager_config_template: 'custom_templates/alertmanager.yml.j2'
```

## Development

For development and testing you can use [molecule](https://molecule.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
With podman as driver you can install it like this – preferably in a virtual environment (if you use docker, substitute `podman` with `docker`):

```bash
pip install -r .dev_requirements.txt
```

Then you can *create* the test instances, apply the ansible config (*converge*) and *destroy* the test instances with these commands:

```bash
molecule create
molecule converge
molecule destroy
```

If you want to inspect a running test instance use `molecule login --host <instance_name>`, where you replace `<instance_name>` with the desired value.
